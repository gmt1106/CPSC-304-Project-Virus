# CPSC-304-Project-Virus

## Project Description
The domain that we are going to model is pandemic monitoring. More specifically, the model shows the current and past situations where there have/had been a pandemic. 
The aspects of the domain that will be modelled include viruses, cures, geographical information, and humans involved (doctors and infected patients) as well as different relationships between them. 
Information regarding viruses that have caused a pandemic will be recorded with their ID and the start date of the corresponding pandemic. 
Countries can have doctors who can treat patients infected with certain viruses using different medication, which can include a cure if there is one. 
The information of people who are not doctors are distinguishable by their identification number and nationality combined and the information is split into two categories; those infected and not infected. 
The routes of these non-doctors will be recorded with timeframe and will include different places where they have visited. 
This database organizes the routes that the infected and not infected people took before they were isolated, number of infected patients in each country, cures for several viruses (not just the Coronavirus), and how the doctors are treating the infected patients.
